## How Sticky Note++ Works

1. **User Registration and Login**:
   - Users can create an account by providing a username and a secure password.
   - After registration, users can log in with their credentials.

2. **Creating and Managing Sticky Notes**:
   - Users can create new sticky notes with titles and content.
   - Sticky notes can be organized, edited, and deleted as needed.

3. **Note Encryption**:
   - Sticky Note++ automatically encrypts each note to protect the content. Encryption is applied at the note level, ensuring data security.

4. **Data Backup**:
   - Users can create a backup of their note database. The backup file is encrypted and can be saved on local storage or in the cloud.

5. **Restoring Data on Another Device**:
   - To use Sticky Note++ on another device, users can import their encrypted backup file.
   - The application decrypts the backup and allows users to access their notes seamlessly.

## Security

Sticky Note++ takes user data security seriously. The application uses strong encryption methods to protect all notes and ensures that only authorized users can access the content.
